			<h2> Interrogation Second Prototype </h2>
			This video shows the SECOND prototype of Interrogation in action. This prototype shows the vibration component working. You can see in the video that when the user lies, the vibration motor goes insane. Then when the user tells the truth, the vibration motor stops. This component will be incorporated into the custom-gaming vest, which is currently under construction.

			<h2> Interrogation First Prototype </h2>
			This video shows the first prototype of Interrogation in action. The user's point-of-view is established and they are able to traverse the narrative. When the user answers a question and is found to be lying, the arduino-connected LED lights up and flashes. The LED turns off when the user tells the truth.
